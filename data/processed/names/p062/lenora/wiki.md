### Meaning
The name Lenora is of Greek origin and it is a variant of the name Eleanor, which means "light" or "torch". The name Eleanor itself is derived from the Provencal name Alienor, which is formed from the Germanic elements "alia" meaning "other" and "nour" meaning "gold". Over time, Alienor evolved into Eleonor in Old French, and then into Eleanor in English. The variant Lenora emerged as a more phonetic spelling. So, Lenora carries the symbolic meaning of "the other gold" or "light", signifying something precious, bright, and illuminating.
