### Meaning
The name Blake is of Old English origin and it has two contrasting meanings. It can mean "black" or "pale". The name is derived from the Old English word "blac", which originally meant "white" or "pale", but over time, due to a linguistic phenomenon called semantic inversion, it also came to mean "black" or "dark". This is because in Old English, "blac" was often used to describe someone with pale skin or hair, but it could also be used to describe someone with dark skin or hair. The name Blake, therefore, carries these dual meanings.
