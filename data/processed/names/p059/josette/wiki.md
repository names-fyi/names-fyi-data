### Meaning
Josette is a French diminutive form of the name Josephine, which itself is a feminine form of Joseph. The name Joseph is of Hebrew origin, derived from the name Yosef, which means "He will add" or "God will increase". Therefore, Josette indirectly carries the meaning "God will increase". The suffix "-ette" in French is a diminutive, indicating something small or endearing, so Josette can be interpreted as a term of endearment meaning "little one whom God will increase".
