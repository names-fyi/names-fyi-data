### Reasons not to pick
:::spoiler
While Sienna is indeed a beautiful name, it's important to consider that it's quite specific in its associations. Sienna is not only a name, but also a color and a city in Italy. This could potentially lead to confusion or unwanted associations as your child grows up. It might be better to choose a name that stands on its own and doesn't carry such specific references.
