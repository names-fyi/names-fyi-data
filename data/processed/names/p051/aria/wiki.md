### Meaning
The name Aria has roots in both Italian and Hebrew. In Italian, "Aria" translates to "air" and is also used to describe a solo performance in an opera, typically done by a single voice with orchestral accompaniment. This usage in music gives the name a connotation of beauty and expressiveness. 

In Hebrew, Aria is a variation of "Ari," which means "lion." When the "a" is added at the end, it becomes "Aria," which can be interpreted as "lioness." This gives the name a sense of strength and courage.
