### Reasons not to pick
:::spoiler
While Lina is indeed a beautiful name, it's worth considering that it's quite short and lacks nickname options. This could limit your child's choices when they grow older and perhaps want a nickname that friends and family can call them by. It's always nice to have a name that can be shortened or altered in a playful or affectionate way.
