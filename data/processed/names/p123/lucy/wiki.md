### Reasons not to pick
:::spoiler
While Lucy is a lovely name, it's worth considering that it can sometimes be confused with similar sounding words in various languages. For instance, in Spanish, "luz" means light and "lucir" means to shine or show off, which could potentially lead to some confusion or mispronunciations. Additionally, in Latin, "lucy" is derived from "lux" which also means light. This could lead to some ambiguity in conversations, especially in multilingual environments. Furthermore, the name Lucy has been used in various cultural and historical contexts, such as the famous Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", which has been associated with drug use. This might not be a connotation you'd want associated with your child's name.
