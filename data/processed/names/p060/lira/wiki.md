### Meaning
The name Lira is of Italian origin and it translates to "lyre" in English. The lyre is a stringed instrument known for its use in Greek classical antiquity and later periods. The lyre is similar to a small harp, although unlike the harp, it is played by strumming or plucking the strings, not by sweeping across them. The name Lira could therefore be interpreted to symbolize harmony and music. The name Lira also shares its spelling with the former currency of Italy, which was called "lira" as well. The currency was named after the instrument due to the presence of a lyre on the first coins issued.
