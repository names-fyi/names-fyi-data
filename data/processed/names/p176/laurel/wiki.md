### Meaning
The name Laurel is of Latin origin and it means "laurel tree" or "bay tree". The laurel tree was symbolic of honor and victory in ancient times. The term "laureate" as in "Poet Laureate" and "Nobel Laureate" comes from the practice of crowning winners with a wreath of laurel leaves, a tradition that started with the ancient Greeks and Romans. The Latin word for laurel is "laurus", which was adapted into the Old French as "lorer", and then into the Middle English as "laurel". This eventually became the name we know today as Laurel.
