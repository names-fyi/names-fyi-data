### Meaning
The name Julian is of Latin origin and it means "youthful" or "downy." It is derived from the Roman family name "Julianus," which was in turn based on the name of the ancient Roman god Jupiter. The root of Jupiter, "Iovis," was originally derived from the Proto-Indo-European "*Dyeu-peter" meaning "sky father." Over time, "Iovis" evolved into "Julius," a Roman family name. The suffix "-anus" was added to denote belonging to the family, thus forming "Julianus." This was later shortened to Julian in English. The youthful or downy connotation comes from an association with the characteristics of youth, such as a downy, soft beard.
