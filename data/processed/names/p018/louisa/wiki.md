### Meaning
The name Louisa is of German and French origin and it means "renowned warrior". It is the feminine form of Louis, which is derived from the Old German Chlodovech, a compound name composed of the elements 'hlud' (loud, famous) and 'wig' (war, battle, fighter), hence implying a famous warrior. The name was borne by 18 kings of France, which further popularized it. The transition from Louis to Louisa involves the addition of the feminine suffix '-a', common in many languages including Latin and Romance languages.
