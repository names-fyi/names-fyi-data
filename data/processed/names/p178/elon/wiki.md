### Reasons not to pick
:::spoiler
Choosing a name for your child is a significant decision. While Elon is a unique and strong name, it's also very closely associated with Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. This could mean that your child's identity might often be overshadowed by this association, and they may constantly have to deal with comments or jokes related to Elon Musk. It's important for a child to have their own identity, separate from any famous figures.
