### Meaning
The name Marcel is of French origin and it means "little warrior". It is derived from the Latin name Marcellus, which is a diminutive form of Marcus. The name Marcus is believed to be derived from Mars, the Roman god of war, hence the meaning "little warrior". The transition from Marcus to Marcellus, and then to Marcel, represents a progression from a strong, warlike figure to a more endearing, diminutive form, while still retaining the essence of strength and bravery.
