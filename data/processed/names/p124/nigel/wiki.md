### Meaning
The name Nigel is of Irish and Gaelic origin and it means "champion" or "black". The name is derived from the Latin name "Nigellus", which itself is a diminutive form of the Latin word "niger" meaning "black". The name was brought to Britain by the Normans and became popular in the Middle Ages. The association with "champion" comes from an Anglicized form of the Irish name "Niall", which is often interpreted as meaning "champion". So, the name Nigel carries connotations of strength and victory, as well as a possible reference to dark hair or complexion.
