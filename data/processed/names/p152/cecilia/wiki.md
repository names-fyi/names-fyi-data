The name Cecilia is of Latin origin and it means "blind". The name is derived from the Latin word "caecus", which means "blind". The feminine form of the name, "Caecilia", was borne by a number of women in the patrician family of the Caecilii in ancient Rome. Over time, "Caecilia" evolved into "Cecilia".
