### Meaning
The name Oliver is of Old Norse origin and it means "ancestor's descendant". It is derived from the elements "anu", which means "ancestor", and "leifr", which means "descendant". The name was brought to England by the Normans and it was popularized there by the character Oliver in Charles Dickens' novel "Oliver Twist". The name has been common in England since the Middle Ages, largely due to the story of Saint Oliver Plunkett who was a 17th-century Irish martyr.
