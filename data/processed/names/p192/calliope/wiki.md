### Reasons not to pick
:::spoiler
While Calliope is indeed a unique and beautiful name, it might pose some challenges. The pronunciation isn't immediately clear upon reading it, which could lead to frequent mispronunciations. It's spelled "Calliope," but pronounced "kuh-LYE-oh-pee," which isn't intuitive. This could be a source of frustration for your child as they constantly correct people. Additionally, Calliope is the name of the muse of epic poetry in Greek mythology. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it does set a high bar and might create undue pressure. Lastly, the name is also associated with a type of musical instrument often used in circuses, which could lead to unwanted associations or teasing.
