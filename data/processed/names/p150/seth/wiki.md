### Meaning
The name Seth is of Hebrew origin and it means "appointed" or "placed". In the Bible, Seth was the third son of Adam and Eve, and his name was given by Eve in Genesis 4:25 where she said, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him." The Hebrew verb שִׁית (shiyth), which means to put or set, is the root of the name Seth. This verb is used in a wide variety of applications in the Hebrew Bible, such as setting a table, placing someone in a position, or appointing someone for a task. Thus, the name Seth carries the connotation of being chosen or appointed for a specific purpose or role.
