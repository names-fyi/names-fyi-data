### Meaning
The name Norman is of Old German origin and it means "northerner" or "man from the north". The name is derived from the Old Norse elements "norr" meaning "north" and "man" meaning "man". It was used to refer to the Vikings who were from the north and later to the Normans, from the historical region of Normandy in France, who were of Viking descent. The Normans were so named because they were "men from the north". The name Norman was then adopted as a given name in English-speaking countries.
