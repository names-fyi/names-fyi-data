### Reasons not to pick
:::spoiler
While Lorena is a beautiful name, it's worth considering that it can be prone to mispronunciation and misspelling. In English-speaking countries, it might be pronounced as "Lor-ee-na" or "Lor-eh-na", leading to potential confusion. Additionally, in other languages, it could be mistaken for similar words. For example, in Spanish, "Lorena" is very close to "Llorona", which refers to a popular folklore figure known as the Weeping Woman. This could lead to unwanted associations or misunderstandings.
