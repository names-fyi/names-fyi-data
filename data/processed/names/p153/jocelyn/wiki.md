### Meaning
The name Jocelyn originates from the Germanic tribe of the Gauts, also known as the Goths. It is derived from the Germanic masculine name "Gautselin," which later evolved into the Old French "Goscelin" or "Joscelin." The name was introduced to England by the Normans in the form "Joscelin," and was typically used for boys. Over time, it became used as a girl's name and evolved into the modern form "Jocelyn."

The original Germanic name "Gautselin" is a diminutive form of a name beginning with the element "Gaut," which was derived from "Gautr," one of the names of Odin, a major god in Norse mythology. "Gautr" is also a byname for a member of the Gauts tribe. The "-selin" part of the name is a diminutive suffix, indicating "little." So, the name Jocelyn can be interpreted to mean "little Gaut," or "little member of the Gauts tribe."
